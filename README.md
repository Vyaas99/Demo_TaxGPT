# Tax GPT: Your AI-Driven Tax Assistant  

This project demonstrates expertise in **full-stack software engineering** by building a robust, scalable, and user-friendly AI-driven tax assistant application using **Streamlit**, **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo**, and **Firebase Admin SDK**.  

## Key Features  

### Frontend Development  
- **Interactive User Interface:** Developed a clean, intuitive interface with Streamlit, providing a seamless user experience for authentication, document uploads, and tax-related query interactions.  
- **Dynamic Sidebar:** Integrated user preferences for tax regions and languages, along with a document uploader for tax files, showcasing attention to UX design and interactivity.  

### Backend Development  
- **AI-Powered Assistant:** Leveraged OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo API for natural language processing, enabling the application to provide detailed, contextual responses to tax-related queries.  
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Implemented robust backend functionality with `pdfminer` to extract text from uploaded tax-related PDF documents for contextual understanding.  
- **Session Management:** Utilized Streamlit's session state to maintain user authentication and conversation history across app interactions.  

### Authentication and Security  
- **Firebase Integration:** Incorporated Firebase Admin SDK for secure user authentication, supporting login and signup functionality with password management.  
- **Secrets Management:** Implemented sensitive data handling (API keys, Firebase credentials) securely using Streamlit Secrets.  

### Scalability and Flexibility  
- **Modular Design:** Organized functionality into reusable methods for user authentication, PDF processing, and chat interactions, facilitating easy maintenance and scalability.  
- **Dynamic Contextual Integration:** Extracted and incorporated context from uploaded files into the assistant's responses, demonstrating adaptability to user-specific data.  

## Technologies and Tools  
- **Programming Languages:** Python for seamless integration of libraries and frameworks.  
- **APIs and Libraries:** OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo for NLP, Firebase Admin SDK for authentication, and `pdfminer` for text extraction from PDFs.  
- **Framework:** Streamlit for rapid development of the interactive web application.  
- **Version Control:** Designed with clear modular functions, ensuring maintainability and compatibility with modern software practices.  

This project showcases the ability to integrate AI capabilities into real-world applications, combining frontend and backend engineering with secure authentication and dynamic data processing, making it a perfect example of end-to-end software engineering expertise.
